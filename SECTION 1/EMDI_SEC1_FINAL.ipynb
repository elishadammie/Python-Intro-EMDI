    "Below is a review of the things you learned in this lesson. I know when I was getting started, I always wanted more practice. This course will move pretty fast from this point forward, so if you feel like you just want more practice problems on a topic, there are a number of free courses on the web. Two that you should definitely take advantage of (for the benefit of this program, but also for finding a job afterward) are [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). Within each of these, you should create a profile and work on mastering Python! I was obsessed with these websites for getting all the practice I needed when I first started programming. As you get better, you can advance to harder problems and sites with even greater challenges. Happy coding"
