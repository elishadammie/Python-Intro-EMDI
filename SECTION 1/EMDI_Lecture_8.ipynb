    "\n",

    "    type(12)\n",
    "    print(\"Hello world\")\n",

    "These three above are functions - notice they use parentheses, and accept one or more [arguments.] Functions will be studied in much more detail in a later lesson!\n",
    "\n",
    "    A method in Python behaves similarly to a function. Methods actually are functions that are called using dot notation. For example, lower() is a string method that can be used like this, on a string called \"sample string\": sample_string.lower().\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are specific to the data type for a particular variable. So there are some built-in methods that are available for all strings, different methods that are available for all integers, etc.\n",
